# Blockchain
A simple blockchain with transactions, cryptography and wallet functions.
It was made to understand the technology better behind cryptocoins.

# My blockchain:
- Is made up of blocks that store data.
- Has a digital signature that chains your blocks together.
- Requires proof of work mining to validate new blocks.
- Can be check to see if data in it is valid and unchanged.
